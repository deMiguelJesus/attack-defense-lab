# Attack-Defense Lab

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create two virtual machines using KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) in Ubuntu Linux one with Kali Linux and the other one with Metasploitable 2. 


Important security measures to take into account before running this example
- Run in an isolated network (no internet).
- Disable auto-bridging to your host.
- Ensure Metasploitable 2 is never exposed to external networks.

## Steps
 
 The steps are the following:

1. Set up the virtual machines
2. Attack the target VM (Ethical Hacking Test)
3. Secure the target VM (Defensive measures)
