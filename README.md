# Attack-Defense Lab

## Project Objectives

1. Set up the lab: Create two virtual machines: (1) **Kali Linux VM** (Attacker machine) – Used for penetration testing; and (2) **Metasploitable 2 VM** (Target machine) – A deliberately vulnerable Linux system.
2. Attack the target VM (Ethical Hacking Test)
3. Secure the target VM (Defensive measures)

## Considerations Objectives

Important security measures to take into account before running this project:
- Run in an isolated network (no internet).
- Disable auto-bridging to your host.
- Ensure Metasploitable 2 is never exposed to external networks.
